<h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
<p>Evernote is an app designed for note taking, organizing, task management, and archiving.[5] It is developed by the Evernote Corporation, headquartered in Redwood City, California. The app allows users to create notes, which can be text, drawings, photographs, audio, or saved web content. Notes are stored in notebooks and can be tagged, annotated, edited, searched, given attachments, and exported.</p>

<h3>Coding and vesions</h3>b
<p>In 2010, the programming language used to write Evernote's software was changed from C# for version 3.5 to C++ in version 4.0 to improve performance.</p>
<h3>Data entry </h3>
<p>As well as the keyboard entry of typed notes, Evernote supports image capture from cameras on supported devices, and the recording of voice notes. In some situations, text that appears in captured images can be recognized using OCR and annotated. Evernote also supports touch and tablet screens with handwriting recognition.</p>
<h3>Data storage and access</h3>
<p>Users with Internet access and an Evernote account can also have their notes automatically synchronized with a master copy held on Evernote's servers. This approach lets a user access and edit their data across multiple machines and operating system platforms, but still view, input and edit data when an Internet connection is not available. However, notes stored on Evernote servers are not encrypted.</p>
<h3>Accounts</h3>
<p>Evernote is a free online service that allows users to upgrade to Premium or Business accounts. All Free, Plus and Premium Evernote accounts have a maximum limit of 100,000 notes and 250 notebooks.</p>
